You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

In Sonnet CIII, he compares love to the ocean that separates two lovers, but ultimately brings them back together. In Sonnet LVII, he reflects on how his love has grown and become stronger over time, despite the challenges and changes that have occurred. In Sonnet CXVI, he suggests that love is a powerful force that can defy mortality and preserve beauty. In Sonnet LXVI, he acknowledges that time may eventually fade physical beauty, but love can still shine brightly through written words.
